# U.S. Web Design Standards Design Assets

This repository hosts editable, open source design files of the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards) for government designers or anyone wishing to make use of the UI components or visual style guide in this site.

For the alpha release, the following file types are available for your use:
- .AI (Adobe Illustrator) 
- .EPS 
- Sketch 
- Omnigraffle
- Font files (Fontawesome, Merriweather, Source Sans Pro)
- Color Swatches

We encourage and solicit your input. Please leave any feedback in the project's primary repo, which you'll find here: https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards

## Installing the color palettes

You have a few options for working with our color palette: You can either use the color swatches included in the Illustrator and Sketch sticker sheet files, or you can install the ASE or Sketch Palette files. To install the files, follow the directions below, and let us know if you run into any difficulty.

### For Sketch

* Begin by adding the Sketch palette plugin, which you can find [here] (https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-palettes).
* Then, from the color picker, select Load Palette... from either the Global Colors or the Document Colors menu. **Please note** that doing this will replace whatever colors are currently in the selected section. If you’re concerned about losing your Global Colors, consider adding our palette to only your Document Colors menu. 
* Navigate to WDS.sketchpalette to install the palette. 

### For Illustrator

* Begin by opening the Swatches panel.
* In the Swatches menu, select Open Swatch Library and then Other Library.
* Navigate to web-design-standards-colors.ase to add the palette.

## About the Sketch files

Some single-function components, such as buttons, have been turned into symbols for easy access from the
symbol menu. Before you alter anything but text, detach the instance of the symbol so that you don’t change
every instance. More complex components, such as footers, have been left as groups.

Wherever appropriate, we have created type styles and layer styles to make these components more easily
adapted.

Style and symbol names are a compromise between U.S. Web Design Standards CSS naming conventions (to
transition Sketch files more easily into development) and names that make sense for when thinking about
screen design.
